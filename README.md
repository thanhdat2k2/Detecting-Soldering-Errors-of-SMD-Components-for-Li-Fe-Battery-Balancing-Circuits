**DETECTING SOLDERING ERRORS OF SMD COMPONENTS FOR LI-FE BATTERY BALANCING CIRCUITS**


**INTRODUCTION**

This project focuses on researching and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the electronic component production line, specifically for Li-Fe (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery balancing circuits.

The objective of the project is to apply AI techniques to support monitoring, evaluation, and classification of circuit components, thereby improving product quality and minimizing errors during the manufacturing process.



**PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

* Apply AI in the Li-Fe battery balancing circuit production line

* Support monitoring and classification of circuit components

* Optimize production costs while ensuring reliable classification results



**SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION – INTERFACE MODULE (WINFORMS)**

* The scope of this repository focuses on the user interface (UI) development of the system.

* **Implemented features**:

  + Building a desktop application UI

  + Designing Windows Forms to support:

    - Displaying production line information

    - Displaying analysis and evaluation results from the AI system

    - Operator interaction with the system

  + Developing the interface using Windows Forms (WinForms) with C#

  + Handling basic UI events:

    - Button click events

    - Form load events

    - Navigation between application screens

⚠️ Business logic, AI model training, and data processing are outside the scope of this module.



**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

* Programming Language: C#

* Framework: .NET WinForms

* IDE: Visual Studio

* Architecture: Standalone UI, designed for easy backend and AI system integration



**NOTES**

* This project is developed for educational, practice, and research purposes

* The source code in this repository represents only the user interface part of the overall project

* The system design can be applied and extended to real-world production lines
